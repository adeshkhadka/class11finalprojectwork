Makalu is a mountain of the Himalaya range, in the Makalu Barun region, 19 km Southeast of Mount Everest, on the border between Nepal and China. With an elevation of 8,463 m, Makalu is the fifth highest mountain in the World and one of the 14 mountains on Earth that are more than 8,000 meters (26,247 ft) high.
<br><br>
Makalu was first climbed by a French team on May 15, 1955. Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy were the first to reach the top on the 15th, while Franco, Magnone, Bouvier, Coupe, Leroux, Vialatte and Sardar Gyaltsen Norbu summitted the following two days.

There are several others notable French ascents; Yannick Seigneur and Bernard Mellet climbed the West Pillar in 1971. In 1988 Marc Batard climbed West Buttress in 24h. One year later, Pierre Beghin soloed the Yugoslav route in the South Face. Then sadly, in January 2006, Jean-Christophe Lafaille disappeared while trying to do the first winter ascent.

As of 2009, 323 climbers reached the top of Makalu among which 20 were French.

The 2014 Makalu Expedition
In April 2014, Philippe and Pasang Gombu teamed up again to climb Makalu. They left Katmandu and trekked to Makalu base camp. It took them 37 days to reach the top before coming back to Katmandu. The entire expedition lasted 56 days.

<br><br>
Philippe and Gombu climbed the French route opened in 1955. This route starts at 5,700 m on the West of Makalu. Then it climbs Makalu La (pass at 7,400 m) before going South to the French Couloir at the bottom of the North face and finishes on the Northeast ridge.

The base camp (BC), also called Hillary base camp, is located at 4,850 on the Barun glacier. In fact, this BC is used only during the trekking. During the expedition, the climbers stay at the advanced base camp (ABC) at 5,700 m.

From the ABC, the route follows a moraine up to crampons point at 5,950 m. Then it goes on the gentle slopes of the glacier to the bottom of a first headwall at 6,250 m where it is possible to set a low camp 1. Climb the headwall to a plateau at 6,370 m where it is also possible to set the camp 1. Pass a small serac to the location of the high camp 1 at 6,450 m.

From the camp 1, climb a short steep slope, cross under a serac and climb another slope to a plateau at 6,650 m. There is a good spot for a camp 2 there, wide enough for a large number of tents.

From the camp 2, climb the gentle snow slopes above, traversing South to the base of the two rock bands coming from Makalu La. The base of the first rock band is at 7,000 m. Climb the steep rocks (rock and mixed terrain) for 150 m up to the middle snow slope (around 200 m at 40Â°) between the two rock bands. Climb the second rock band, less steep than the first one but higher. Exit on the right of the actual Makalu La, continue on the snow slope until a large plateau. The camp 3 can be set on the plateau at around 7,470 m. The plateau is very large and flat but very exposed to Westerly winds.

From the camp 3, continue on the plateau toward the Southwest. Climb a small wall (mixed terrain). Continue to the rocks at 7,570 m to set the camp 4. The distance between C3 and C4 is about 1km and +100 m, so some climbers skip the C4 and start their summit bid from C3.
<br><br>
From the camp 4, climb almost straight on the glacier up to 7,770 m. Cross the seracs to reach the other side of the glacier. From there, climb on the glacier almost straight again up to 8,200 m, then traverse to reach the bottom of the French Couloir. Climb the left side of the French Couloir. It is mainly a rock and mixed climb with four short (2m) but harder sections. The end of the Couloir is less steep and becomes more snowy. Reach the snow ridge at 8,400 m and follow it. This ridge is relatively large and easy until the base of the false summit. Climb the false summit on the right, it is short but steep and exposed. Traverse from the false to the true summit, avoiding the cornice. Again the climb is short but exposed. Reach the tiny summit at 8,463 m.
