Interesting facts about Dhaulagiri
Dhaulagiri is the highest mountain located entirely in Nepal.

Several attempts were made to reach Dhaulagiri’s summit between the years 1950-1959 by Swiss, French, Argentine and Austrian climbers. Each attempt was made via the north side of the mountain, and each attempt failed.

It was not until 1960 when the first successful ascent was made via the Northeast side by a Swiss-Austrian team led by Max Eiselin.

Upon its discovery in 1808, Dhaulagiri was thought to be the world’s highest mountain, displacing Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.

Dhaulagiri stands over the great Kali Gandaki Valley, which by some measures is the deepest gorge on earth, as it is flanked by two 8000m (26,250ft) peaks (Dhaulagiri I & Annapurna I).
