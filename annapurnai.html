<font size="5"><p>Annapurna, Nepali Annapurna Himal, massif of the Himalayas in north-central Nepal. It forms a ridge some 30 miles (48 km) long between the gorges of the Kali (Kali Gandak; west) and Marsyandi (east) rivers north of the town of Pokhara. The massif contains four main summits, two of which—Annapurna I (26,545 feet [8,091 metres]) and II (26,040 feet [7,937 metres])—stand at the western and eastern ends of the range, respectively; Annapurna III (24,786 feet [7,555 metres]) and IV (24,688 feet [7,525 metres]) lie between them.
<br><br>
Annapurna I is the world’s 10th highest peak. Although climbers had reached 28,150 feet (8,580 metres) on Mount Everest by 1924, Annapurna I became famous in 1950 as the first peak above 26,000 feet (8,000 metres) to be ascended to the summit. The feat was achieved by a French expedition led by Maurice Herzog, who with Louis Lachenal reached the top on June 3. Annapurna IV was climbed on May 30, 1955, by a German team of Harald Biller, Heinz Steinmetz, and Jürgen Wellenkamp; and Annapurna II on May 17, 1960, by the British climbers Richard Grant and Chris Bonington and the Sherpa Ang Nyima in an expedition led by James O.M. Roberts. In 1970 an all-women Japanese climbing team scaled Annapurna III.
