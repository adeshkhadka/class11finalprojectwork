<p>A country of great beauty, Nepal is home to eight of the 14 highest mountains in the world. The Himalayan mountain range extends across the country from the eastern edge to the western edge. This conglomeration of beautiful and rugged mountain peaks has drawn mountain trekkers and climbers from all over the world. Many come here to test their skills, their mental and physical strength and their endurance. Others are drawn to the mountains of Nepal for more spiritual reasons. Whatever the case, you can be sure that you will enjoy Nepal's mountains – even if you only see them from a distance.
<br><br>
Most people traveling to Nepal come here to enjoy the striking backdrop of the Himalayas. This striking mountain range is home to the world-famous Mount Everest and many people come here just to try and climb the biggest mountain in the world. Still many others who visit enjoy trekking through the Himalayas, climbing smaller mountains and taking photographs. There is a lot to be seen and done in the Himalayas of Nepal and you do not always have to be an experienced and very fit climber to travel up some of the mountain peaks.
<br><br>
There are several noteworthy mountains in Nepal worth visiting if you are able. The first, of course, is Mount Everest though only a few ever brave the incredible and painstaking journey to the summit. The average visitor may spend some time at the Everest base camp or they may choose to view the biggest mountain in the world from another mountain peak such as Kala Patthar which offers better views than those enjoyed at the Everest base camp. Some of the mountains are extremely steep and icy while others are not quite so steep. Some noteworthy mountains in Nepal include Kangchenjunga, Lhotse, Cho Oyu, Makalu, Dhaulagiri, Anna Purna, Imja Tse, Ama Dablam and Mansalu.
<br><br>
If you are planning to spend time among some of these legendary mountains when you next visit Nepal, keep in mind that the altitude is extreme and so is the weather. Even in the warmer months, the mountains are usually coated with snow and ice and the air has an unbeatable chill to it. You’ll need special equipment and it also helps to remember that you’ll need the services of an experienced guide as well as a legal permit to climb the mountains. The Himalayas are definitely not the sort of place you go for your first attempt at mountain climbing so you should be sure that you have gained adequate experience before booking your ticket. When you do come, remember to pack warmly, be prepared for anything and get ready to start your adventure in the mountains of Nepal.
