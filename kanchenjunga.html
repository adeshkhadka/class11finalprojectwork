<p><font size="5">Kanchenjunga, also spelled Kangchenjunga or Kinchinjunga, Nepali Kumbhkaran Lungur, world’s third highest mountain, with an elevation of 28,169 feet (8,586 metres). It is situated in the eastern Himalayas on the border between Sikkim state, northeastern India, and eastern Nepal, 46 miles (74 km) north-northwest of Darjiling, Sikkim. The mountain is part of the Great Himalaya Range. The Kanchenjunga massif is in the form of a gigantic cross, the arms of which extend north, south, east, and west.
<br><br>
Kanchenjunga is composed of rocks of Neoproterozoic (late Precambrian) to Ordovician age (i.e., about 445 million to 1 billion years old). The mountain and its glaciers receive heavy snow during the summer monsoon season and a lighter snowfall during the winter. The individual summits connect to neighbouring peaks by four main ridges, from which four glaciers flow—the Zemu (northeast), the Talung (southeast), the Yalung (southwest), and the Kanchenjunga (northwest).
<br><br>
The name Kanchenjunga is derived from four words of Tibetan origin, usually rendered Kang-chen-dzo-nga or Yang-chhen-dzö-nga and interpreted in Sikkim as the “Five Treasuries of the Great Snow.” The mountain holds an important place in the mythology and religious ritual of the local inhabitants, and its slopes were no doubt familiar to herdsmen and traders for centuries before a rough survey of it was made.
<br><br>
The first known map of Kanchenjunga was made by Rinzin Namgyal, one of the pandit (“learned”) explorers of the mid-19th century, who made a circuital sketch. In 1848 and 1849 Sir Joseph Hooker, a botanist, was the first European to visit and describe the region, and in 1899 the explorer-mountaineer Douglas Freshfield traveled around the mountain. In 1905 an Anglo-Swiss party attempted Freshfield’s suggested Yalung valley route, and four members perished in an avalanche.
<br><br>
Mountaineers later explored other faces of the massif. A Bavarian expedition led by Paul Bauer in 1929 and 1931 vainly attempted to climb it from the Zemu side, and in 1930 the German-Swiss climber Günter O. Dyhrenfurth attempted it from the Kanchenjunga Glacier. The greatest height reached during these explorations was 25,263 feet (7,700 metres) in 1931. Fatal accidents on two of these expeditions gave the mountain a reputation for unusual danger and difficulty. No one else attempted to climb it until 1954, when, partly because the Sikkimese objected, attention was again turned to the Yalung face, which is in Nepal. Gilmour Lewis’s visits to the Yalung in 1951, 1953, and 1954 led to a 1955 British expedition led by Charles Evans, under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club (London), which stopped within a few yards of the actual summit in deference to the religious beliefs and wishes of the Sikkimese. Other Kanchenjunga climbing milestones include the first woman to reach the summit (Briton Ginette Harrison in 1998), the first solo ascent (Frenchman Pierre Béghin in 1983), and the first ascent without the use of supplemental oxygen (Britons Peter Boardman, Doug Scott, and Joe Tasker in 1979).
